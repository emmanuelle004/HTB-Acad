Ethernet is a collection of network protocols/standards.

Network protocols are necessary to ensure interoperability between devices from different vendors or platforms. This results in vendor neutrality. Also, it is useful for
modularity via layers, that is, upgrade por modify parts without breaking others. Lastly, promotes sacalability and troubleshooting because knowing what each layer/protocol 
handles lets one isolate faults quickly.

Transmission Types include analog and digital.
Analog: uses continuous signals to represent information. e.g. In traditional radio broadcasts.
Digital: uses discrete signals (bits) to encode data.

Transmission Modes: Simplex, Haf-duples, and Full-duplex.
Simplex: allows one-way communication only where signals travel in a single direction. e.g. keyboard to a computer.
Half-Duplex: allows two-way communication but not simultaneously
Full-duplex: allows two-way communication simultaneouly.

Connections between network devices operate at a defined speed measured in bits per second.
A bit is a vlue represented by either 0 or 1.
A byte is 8 bits.

1 kilobit (kb) = 1,000 bits
1 megabit (Mb) = 1,000,000 bits
1 gigabit (Gb) = 1,000,000,000 bits
1 terabit (Tb) = 1,000,000,000,000 bits

Ethernet Standards are defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard. (1983)
IEEE = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

Speed    --   Common Name   -- IEEE Standard -- Informal Name -- Max Length  -- # of wires used
10 Mbps  --     Ethernet    --   802.3i    -- 10BASE-T        -- 100m        -- 2 pairs (4 wires)
100 Mbps -- Fast Ethernet   --   802.3u    -- 100BASE-T       -- 100m        -- 2 pairs (4 wires)
1 Gbps   --   Gig Ethernet  --   802.3ab   -- 1000BASE-T      -- 100m        -- 4 pairs (8 wires)
10 Gbps  -- 10 Gig Ethernet --   802.3an   -- 10GBASE-T       -- 100m        -- 4 pairs (8 wires)

where BASE refers to baseband signaling and T is twisted pair.

Ethernet standards use Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cables.
- Unshielded means the wires have no shielding making them vulnerable to electromagnetic interferance (EMI).
-Twisted pair is for the 4 pairs of wired that are twisted together.
Ethernet cables are usually terminated using a registered jack (RJ) 45 connectors. An RJ45 connector has 8 pins,
just as Ethernet cables have 8 wires.

10-BASE-T and 100-BASE-T use 2 pairs.
PCs, routers, firewalls, and other network devices use pins 1 & 2 to transmit (Tx) and pins 3 & 6 are used to receive data(Rx). 
Switches Rx data on pins 1 & 2 and Tx on pins 3 & 6. This allows for full-duplux transmission (send and receive data at the same time).
