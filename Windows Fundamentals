## 0. Windows Overview 

- Microsoft Windows started as a GUI on top of MS-DOS (1985) and evolved through many releases (NT, 2000, XP, 7, 10, 11).
- Windows Server editions (NT → 2000 → 2003 → 2008 → 2012 → 2016 → 2019+) added:
  - Centralized management (Active Directory, Group Policy, MMC)
  - Web, file, and application services
  - Virtualization (Hyper-V), clustering, and security features
- Each version has a specific **version number** (e.g. 5.1 = XP, 6.1 = 7, 10.0 = 10/Server 2016+).
- Older/legacy versions become unsupported and are common sources of risk in real environments.

Security takeaway:
Running out-of-support Windows (old desktop or server versions) increases exposure to known vulnerabilities (e.g. SMBv1/EternalBlue)
Being able to quickly identify Windows versions helps assess exposure to known vulnerabilities and missing patches.

## 1. RDP & PowerShell Enumeration

### Remote Access

- Remote access = interacting with a system over the network instead of locally.
- Common methods: VPN, SSH, VNC, WinRM, FTP, RDP.
- RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):
  - Client/server model, default port = 3389
  - Lets you use a remote Windows system as if you’re physically at the desktop.
  - In secure environments: restrict by firewall/VPN, use strong auth and proper certificates.

Typical command from linux:

xfreerdp /v:<target-ip> /u:<username> /p:<password>
xfreerdp3 /v:<target-ip> /u:<username> /p:<password>


### PowerShell / WMI: Identifying the OS

Used PowerShell’s `Get-WmiObject` to query Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):

powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | Select Version, BuildNumber
